      As a member of a development team at Bitwise Industries, I contributed
      several features and bug fixes to a client software program for companies
      that schedule logistics and care for people with special needs. These
      features included a calendar for both the schedule setters and the
      transporters who provide the care. The work helped improve the efficiency
      and effectiveness of the software, ultimately benefiting the companies and
      individuals using it to manage logistics and care.
